# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This is a single-context repo.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, if present.
- ADRs under `docs/adr/`, if present and relevant to the area being changed.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/adr/
|   |-- 0001-example-decision.md
|   `-- 0002-example-decision.md
`-- app/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept is not in the glossary yet, either the project does not use that language or there is a real gap to note for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly instead of silently overriding it.
